# 👋 Hi, I’m @alfrol

## 👀 I’m interested in coding.

I like building interesting applications and solving interesting problems.  
Although I don't have much experience, I've already tried myself in building secure web applications using **Angular** and **Spring Boot**.  
I've worked with Python library for creating backend applications called **Flask**.  
I've some experience in creating reactive web apps using **React**.  
I have some experience with **Docker**.  

## 👓 I’m currently learning everything...
Okay, I am learning **Computer Science** in Tallinn University of Technology (AKA TalTech).  
Besides that I try to educate myself by completeing different **courses**.  
For example right now I am in the beginning phase of learning a **C++ programming language**.  
In the future I would really like to build a **game** using Unreal Engine and C++.  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects.
I've no much experience in working on **open-source projects** and I would like to try this out one day.

## 📫 How to reach me?
