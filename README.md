# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alfrol

I am a graduate of **TalTech** where I studied Informatics and received a degree **Bachelor of Science in Engineering** ðŸŽ“.

I am passionate about writing **good and clean code** which helps to solve all kinds of problems. I don't have a preferred programming language nor framework and am open to all learning possibilities. During my studies I mostly focused on **Java**, **Python** and **JavaScript** languages, however I also know a bit of **Kotlin** and **PHP**. I have also tried my hand on **Swift** and **IOS development**.

At work and during my studies I have practised **Agile development** using such techniques like **Scrum** and **Kanban**.
My interests vary a lot from **Android development** to writing **Web applications**. My main interest is to **innovate** myself and work on interesting projects.
